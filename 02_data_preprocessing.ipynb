                  "Nice place off of 3rd and Central in downtown St Pete. Went here with my boss after some training and choose a place with a seafood flare. \n\nOysters were ok, I'm used to the salty semi-large Gulf oysters of south Louisiana. The ones we had were from the gulf, but had a neutral tone to its flavor profile. \n\nWe had the blue cheese bacon fries; wonderful but shy on the bacon. Buffalo Shrimp; amazing. The flavor was Sriracha meets a sweet Thai sauce. But wasn't a Thai sauce. Really good. Lump Crab Cake; tasty but not lump crab. Calamari; very good. \n\nService was great!",

Original review at the bottom:\nI went back to this company because as seen below, they did a fabulous job on our home window tinting almost 2 years ago.  This time I wanted to put a ceramic film on the windows of our new Tesla which has so much glass, it is like a greenhouse on wheels and sucks in all the heat from the sun!  As I learned from Greg and others, smoked glass doesn't mean that it blocks the infrared and UV from coming in and cooking everything inside.  So to reduce the heat and keep the UV from damaging the interior leather and other materials, I wanted a clear ceramic film to block those rays.  And I am not going to trust work on a car this expensive to just anyone.\n\nAs expected, these guys did a terrific job at a reasonable price.  I can't see where the film ends on the windows.  Also, this is an especially difficult car to put film on the windows.  More difficult than any other car, yet the end result is perfect.\n\nThese folks are always going to be my \"go to\" company for any type of tinting or clear film.  Thanks Greg and team for beautiful work.  I am no longer suffering from heat in the Tesla and the range is greater due to less need for air conditioning.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:   2015\nI called these guys last weekend and they indicated someone would come see our home on Monday about estimating home window tinting, but no one showed up.  It seems the information never got to the estimator.  After calling back, they scheduled a person to come out the next day.\n\nDan, our estimator (and window film installer) was a nice courteous man whom was thorough and spent as much time as we needed to make a selection from the many samples he had.  Dan was informative and had good suggestions.  Apparently he has been doing this for a VERY LONG time.  The price was right so we told him to order the film.\n\nWithin a week, he was back to do the job on all South facing windows and sliding door.  FABULOUS job and he finished in a few hours.  It's practically impossible to notice there is any film on the windows which is what we wanted.  We chose a light film mainly to cut out the sun's UV and infrared to prevent damaging the furniture and reduce the heat coming through the window.\n\nCutting Edge Window tinting is your company for any tinting job.  The do things to perfection and no shortcuts.  We will be calling him back to do other windows later.\n\nThanks for a great job.",

This place gets really busy around lunch time and sometimes you might feel a bit rushed to finish your meal due to the limited spaces.\n\nThe Terakawa Ramen was ok, but definitely had better. First off, aesthetically, it looks beautiful. The broth was ok, it was lacking a little bit in flavor as if it was watered down a little for ramen.  I love the two eggs and these were well marinated. The charsu was fatty, flavorful, and melts in your mouth.\nMy biggest issue, which I couldn't place at the beginning, but became more apparent as I ate was the noodles. The texture of the noodles were more like spaghetti noodles and it threw the mouthfeel for a loop. The noodle texture wasn't as noticeable at first, but it defiantly didn't help me finish the meal.\n\nOverall, the place is reasonably priced for their meals. It's hard personally for me to enjoy it since the noodles are not to my taste. Someone else might like it so it could be a good place to try.",

Hope this one does because I really like sports bars. \n\nFor starters, the menu is really good and it is priced very reasonable except for soda and coffee.  Soda is $3.00 a glass and coffee is $3.00 a cup. You can buy some beers cheaper!!!!  It's tough when you have a party of 4 that doesn't drink and you get charged $12.00 for soda and $12.00 for coffee.\nThat's $24.00 extra plus an extra $1.44 tax and an extra $5.00 for the tip (20% of $24.00) So add $30.44 to the bill.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture.\n\nAnyway the food is really good and so is the selection. I had the roast beef sandwich once and it was good but I prefer roast beef sliced not pulled.  Last week when I was there I asked the waitress about that and she said sometimes it is pulled and sometimes it is sliced depending on the cook... To me...Not a good answer.\n\nThe service is just OK...they are fast but too forgetful.  Not uncommon to ask a few times for something . \n\nIf you drink DECAF coffee MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE THE SERVING POT.  IF IT IS NOT ORANGE THAN DO NOT DRINK IT.  TWICE this happened to me.\nThe first time I lay away a 3 a.m.  \n\nThe second visit the waitress came around with the pot I questioned the BROWN\ncoffee carafe and she swore it was DECAF.   If they were still open a 3 a.m I would have taken a ride up there to show her that I was STILL AWAKE.\n\nLast week I complained to our server and she said they do have an Orange carafe\nand if she served us from the brown carafe she did not give us decaf. \n\nSaturday nights are not good or I should say they are good but only up until 9 p.m\nAt 9 p.m. the BAND comes in and you cannot hear yourself think!!!!!\nSo if you are planning to go on Saturday nights then either plan to leave early or learn sign language.\n\nHope the owner takes some of my criticism....I mean any disrespect...

The turkey sausage was also very good and the eggs with cheese were what you'd expect for eggs with cheese. I made a sandwich out of the biscuit, sausage and eggs with cheese. Awesome!!\n\nOn the downside, our food took a little longer to come out than I would have liked. The pancakes looked like they'd be delicious but were a bit cold. The butter I put on them did not even melt into the cake. My eggs were also a little cold, but they weren't bad. I'll chalk up the downside to them being crowded and very busy this Sunday morning.

Honestly, if it wasn't for some chili oil and an egg i would have hated it even more, since i like my broth to be on thicker side with tons of flavors and heat. On top of that, the pork-to-fat ratio was just straight up sad. I am happy to say, the waiter honored my wishes and brought me some new, properly cooked pieces.

Labeling their items also helps people with allergies and other dietary restrictions. But to be truly healthy, they would need a lot less cheese/butter/milk in their items. I probably won't go back unless they offered more vegan options.\n\nI also wish they offered more organic ingredients.

                  "I like the idea of this place because it seemed to put a healthy spin on the usual all-you-can-eat obesity feasts we normally see in the South. \n\nIt has some good features- I like the shredded beets, radishes, squash- things you don't always get in a salad bar.\n\nBut where I was disappointed was the lack of vegan options and labeling. Labeling their items also helps people with allergies and other dietary restrictions. But to be truly healthy, they would need a lot less cheese/butter/milk in their items. I probably won't go back unless they offered more vegan options.\n\nI also wish they offered more organic ingredients. I know that will add to the expense, but you can selectively pick which foods it makes the most sense to buy organic (greens, fruits/veg where you eat the skins, etc.) and keep costs fairly low.",

Original review at the bottom:\nI went back to this company because as seen below, they did a fabulous job on our home window tinting almost 2 years ago.  This time I wanted to put a ceramic film on the windows of our new Tesla which has so much glass, it is like a greenhouse on wheels and sucks in all the heat from the sun!  As I learned from Greg and others, smoked glass doesn't mean that it blocks the infrared and UV from coming in and cooking everything inside.  So to reduce the heat and keep the UV from damaging the interior leather and other materials, I wanted a clear ceramic film to block those rays.  And I am not going to trust work on a car this expensive to just anyone.\n\nAs expected, these guys did a terrific job at a reasonable price.  I can't see where the film ends on the windows.  Also, this is an especially difficult car to put film on the windows.  More difficult than any other car, yet the end result is perfect.\n\nThese folks are always going to be my \"go to\" company for any type of tinting or clear film.  Thanks Greg and team for beautiful work.  I am no longer suffering from heat in the Tesla and the range is greater due to less need for air conditioning.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:   2015\nI called these guys last weekend and they indicated someone would come see our home on Monday about estimating home window tinting, but no one showed up.  It seems the information never got to the estimator.  After calling back, they scheduled a person to come out the next day.\n\nDan, our estimator (and window film installer) was a nice courteous man whom was thorough and spent as much time as we needed to make a selection from the many samples he had.  Dan was informative and had good suggestions.  Apparently he has been doing this for a VERY LONG time.  The price was right so we told him to order the film.\n\nWithin a week, he was back to do the job on all South facing windows and sliding door.  FABULOUS job and he finished in a few hours.  It's practically impossible to notice there is any film on the windows which is what we wanted.  We chose a light film mainly to cut out the sun's UV and infrared to prevent damaging the furniture and reduce the heat coming through the window.\n\nCutting Edge Window tinting is your company for any tinting job.  The do things to perfection and no shortcuts.  We will be calling him back to do other windows later.\n\nThanks for a great job.",

Hope this one does because I really like sports bars. \n\nFor starters, the menu is really good and it is priced very reasonable except for soda and coffee.  Soda is $3.00 a glass and coffee is $3.00 a cup. You can buy some beers cheaper!!!!  It's tough when you have a party of 4 that doesn't drink and you get charged $12.00 for soda and $12.00 for coffee.\nThat's $24.00 extra plus an extra $1.44 tax and an extra $5.00 for the tip (20% of $24.00) So add $30.44 to the bill.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture.\n\nAnyway the food is really good and so is the selection. I had the roast beef sandwich once and it was good but I prefer roast beef sliced not pulled.  Last week when I was there I asked the waitress about that and she said sometimes it is pulled and sometimes it is sliced depending on the cook... To me...Not a good answer.\n\nThe service is just OK...they are fast but too forgetful.  Not uncommon to ask a few times for something . \n\nIf you drink DECAF coffee MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE THE SERVING POT.  IF IT IS NOT ORANGE THAN DO NOT DRINK IT.  TWICE this happened to me.\nThe first time I lay away a 3 a.m.  \n\nThe second visit the waitress came around with the pot I questioned the BROWN\ncoffee carafe and she swore it was DECAF.   If they were still open a 3 a.m I would have taken a ride up there to show her that I was STILL AWAKE.\n\nLast week I complained to our server and she said they do have an Orange carafe\nand if she served us from the brown carafe she did not give us decaf. \n\nSaturday nights are not good or I should say they are good but only up until 9 p.m\nAt 9 p.m. the BAND comes in and you cannot hear yourself think!!!!!\nSo if you are planning to go on Saturday nights then either plan to leave early or learn sign language.\n\nHope the owner takes some of my criticism....I mean any disrespect...

I sold a quantity of silver dollars and other silver coins,  and I was very impressed with Pete Dodge. I went into the appointment with a pretty good idea that I would be selling my coins almost totally for the value of the silver content in them. Pete took the time to individually look at each coin, separating them into 4 categories based on condition.  Even the poorest condition was worth more than the silver content,  and some of the better conditioned coins were worth up to more than twice the silver value.  He also picked out a number of coins that had more numismatic value than just the silver content and condition warranted,  and gave me a fair price for those separately. I left with a check for significantly more than I thought I would.\nI recommend Nashville Coin Gallery and Pete Dodge highly to anyone looking for a fair,  professional coin dealer.

I had the short rib burger, it was cooked to my specifications, but was nothing special considering the price. We ordered ice tea, glass became empty and stayed that way. Asked for water, it never was delivered. The place was not that busy, they had a lot of wait staff, so no reason for the poor service. BTW, the staff was very polite, just not attentive. Adult supervision might help.",

Ordered a chair and went to the warehouse for pickup, and the warehouse worker dropped it and broke a leg right in front of me. Then while he was trying to repair it, we noticed the chair had gotten smudged and stained and the warehouse guy tried claiming it was always that way. It was brand new when I bought it! Had to leave without the chair so they could repair and clean it. Then they refused to deliver it unless I drove all the way out to the warehouse again to \"look at it.\" I asked if they'd managed to clean it and they would not give an answer. When I asked if they would be offering a discount since I purchased a new chair that they damaged, they said they would promise nothing, but if they chose to offer a discount, they would rescind the free delivery. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Finally had them refund the whole thing.

                  "Absolutely horrible experience. They care nothing about treating their customers right. Ordered a chair and went to the warehouse for pickup, and the warehouse worker dropped it and broke a leg right in front of me. Then while he was trying to repair it, we noticed the chair had gotten smudged and stained and the warehouse guy tried claiming it was always that way. It was brand new when I bought it! Had to leave without the chair so they could repair and clean it. Then they refused to deliver it unless I drove all the way out to the warehouse again to \"look at it.\" I asked if they'd managed to clean it and they would not give an answer. When I asked if they would be offering a discount since I purchased a new chair that they damaged, they said they would promise nothing, but if they chose to offer a discount, they would rescind the free delivery. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Finally had them refund the whole thing. I will never go back and I'm telling everyone I know not to shop there as they disrespect and mistreat their customers and their purchases.",

                  "decent-good chinese food, very posh decor, and excellent service which is probably why they can charge as much as they do $7-11/dish. when i decided i wanted chinese food for dinner, i was shocked to be brought to palais de jade. the first thing you notice when you walk in is the beautiful bar, with a slightly older crowd sitting around drinking cognac and wine i felt a bit out of place until i saw a couple of families with younger kids sitting around enjoying their meals. the service was really impressive especially after years of crappy restaurants around colleges - at least four waiters were constantly checking on our table throughout the night, and our water glasses were never empty. we ordered the westlake beef soup - delicious, the minced beef practically melted in our mouths and was perfectly seasoned - maybe the best i've ever had, lemon chicken - lightly coated and deep fried, but not at all oily, mongolian beef - not very spicy, but well flavored, chicken fried rice - slightly dry, but yummy and had huge pieces of chicken, and tofu, black mushrooms and snow peas - which was in a gravy that i didn't really like, but wasn't too bad all in all. the drink menu also had champagne in addition to the wine and liquers - i also saw a couple with some margarita looking drinks that looked super good, but i wasn't in the mood when i went. after trying a few other places in reno that weren't that hot, i would definitely recommend palais de jade. hell, i'd go there again just for the service.",

[NUM]/[NUM]/[NUM] update: in need of a new microwave oven, i researched the local retailers on-line rather than waste gas driving from store to store. comparison shopping determined the model i had in mind was least expensive here. knowing what i wanted in advance helped, because i was able to go directly to the appliance section, grab the item off the shelf, and head to the register without need of sales assistance . . . which is just as well, because there was none to be seen in the area anyway.",

                  "bruka theatre is a long-running local community theater that presents a wide variety of plays and musicals each season. i've been there many times, and it's a fun, quirky place to support local theater. inside, the seating is all on ratty, secondhand couches, from loveseats to big sectionals. if you're in a group of two or three, you'll probably get your own couch, but if you're by yourself or arrive late, you sit wherever there's room, so arrive early for the best seats. there are a couple of rows of movie-theater-type seats in the front for those who don't want to lounge on musty, funky couches. drinks including beer and wine and snacks are sold downstairs, which is also where the bathrooms are beware, the ladies' room is a scary one-seater, so it's best to go before you go. some productions are also presented downstairs, where there's a small stage and some cafe-style table seating. you don't receive actual paper tickets - call in advance to book seats or pay at the door. they will validate parking at the nearby parking garage at 1st and sierra, but you have to remember to bring your ticket along. while the quality of the material, acting, and sets varies, an evening at bruka is usually entertaining, if nothing else. but beware - if the play you're seeing is a yawner, those comfy couches make it all too easy to fall asleep. and yes, the audience and the actors can hear you snore.",

                  "sports bars are not where you will usually find me, because the main activities that take place there playing pool, drinking beer, getting hit on are not ones that i find interesting. but every so often, against my better judgment, i allow a friend to drag me to one of these places. spiro's is a local chain of sports bars, and the snappy pseudo-acropolis font on their sign is about as greek as they get. okay, yes, you can get a greek salad there, and i think gyros as well, but that's as far as it goes. personally, i'd like to see the servers in togas and laurel wreaths, but then i'm here in reno, where costumed waiters are pretty much the norm. anyway, the menu has all the usual greasy, deep-fried bar food. i had chicken fingers and fries here that were just fine, and apparently they make pretty good sandwiches, too. the greek salad is heavily sprinkled with feta and a yummy dressing, so although it's not exactly healthy, it's a tasty side. for whatever reason, business is slow here, so the bar area is pretty quiet - maybe a half-dozen people on a saturday evening. the back room contains some pool tables and the most expensive jukebox i've ever seen [NUM] per song! and the music is all nickelstain'dcreedback crap. pool is [NUM] per game, and there's table service in the back room, so you don't even have to lumber over to the bar for your fatty food. things liven up considerably when the karaoke starts, although the crowd is well-behaved and happy-drunk, so it's fun to watch them boozily link arms and belt out country songs or bad '90s one-hit wonders. spiro's is a family sports bar, if such a thing exists - the vibe is very mellow and non-sleazy, and my friend regularly takes her young son there to play pool. the bathrooms are clean and not scary. you could certainly go there to watch a game or have a quick meal without being harassed by icky guys, so as sports bars go, spiro's is about as good as they come.",
